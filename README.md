# Simple Counter App

This is a simple web application that demonstrates a basic counter functionality. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a counter with increment and decrement buttons.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeremiahcaleb/simple-counter-app.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Use the "Increment" button to increase the counter value and the "Decrement" button to decrease it. The counter starts at 0.

## Features

- Displays a counter value that can be incremented or decremented.
- User-friendly interface with clear buttons for interaction.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.


## Code Structure

- **Counter Display**: The current counter value is displayed on the web page.

- **Increment Button**: Clicking the "Increment" button increases the counter value.

- **Decrement Button**: Clicking the "Decrement" button decreases the counter value, but it doesn't go below 0.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page and the container for the counter.

- **CSS**: Styling for the app, including colors, fonts, and layout.

- **JavaScript**: Logic for updating and manipulating the counter value.

## How it Works

The counter value is stored in a JavaScript variable (`counterValue`). The `updateCounter` function is responsible for updating the displayed counter value on the webpage. The `increment` and `decrement` functions modify the counter value and then call `updateCounter` to reflect the changes.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the app by modifying the styles in the `styles.css` page or adding additional features to enhance its functionality.
